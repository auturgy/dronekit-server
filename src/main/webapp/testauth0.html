    <title>Auth0 test page</title>

<!-- Attn 3DR Frontend geeks - the following sample code was from https://auth0.com/docs/quickstart/webapp/java
On the auth0 webside they have numerous other example ways of raising a sign in dialog.

See here: https://auth0.com/docs/lock and the general auth0 docs.

If you would like to use redirect mode (as I did for the BE test - but it might not be the best flow for your app):
Once you know what URL you would like the backend to redirect to on success or failure, please tell me what
that is and I'll plug it in... (i.e. auth0 would bounce through the BE so the BE could squirel away the user info then
the BE could bounce to a URL of your choice)

Once you've run this little test page hosted _within_ the backend then future backend requests from the same session
should be auto authenticated based on that auth0 user.

Please try this and let me know what changes you need ASAP and I'll put them in.
